\section{Status: EXPERIMENTAL}

This is a EXPERIMENTAL package. 

It can disappear without notice e.\,g. if the \package{luaotfload} changes so that it no longer work, or if luatex changes, or if \package{fontspec} includes the code.

It is also possible that syntax and commands change in a incompatible way. So if you use it in a production environment: \textbf{You have been warned}.

\section{Introduction}
In version 2.7. \package{luaotfload} supports combining characters from multiple fonts into a single virtualized one.

That means that one can build a font that takes e.g. the capital letters from a sans serif font and the lowercase letters from a serif font. Or a font that pulls in missing greek or cyrillic glyphs from another font.

The methods pulls in \emph{only} glyphs. It is not suitable for every imaginable font combination -- some drawbacks are described below -- and one should use it with care. Nevertheless it is a quite neat extension of the tools to manipulate fonts.

The main problem with the examples in the \package{luaotfload} manual is that it creates fonts of a fix size. This means that they don't respond to command like \verb+\large+ or \verb+\footnotesize+. 

After trying around a bit and then asking a question (https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/371647/call-a-luatex-combo-font-through-nfss) I got from David Carlisle the idea to use a \texttt{size}-Funktion which one define with \verb+\DeclareSizeFunction+ to inject the needed code to size the combo-font in a nfss-\verb+\DeclareFontShape+-command.

\package{combofont.sty} is the result. 

It is not meant as a production package but as package that helps to exploit the use of combo fonts. 

\section{Requirements}
You need at least an up-to-date TeXLive 2016. TeXLive 2017 with luatex 1.0.4. or a current miktex is better.


\section{Using combo fonts}

To be able to use a combo font with standard \LaTeX\ font commands you have to do two things (the source code of this documentation is a complete example):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Setup and describe the building of the combo font with \verb+\setupcombofont+

\item Write \texttt{nfss}-declarations 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setup the combo font}

\DescribeMacro\setupcombofont{<name>}{<comma list of basefonts>}{<comma list of ranges and code-points>}

\begin{description}
  \item[\marg{name}] is the name of the font. It should be some unique ascii-string without spaces. If you intent to define lots of fonts it would be a good idea to think about a sensible naming sheme. In the example here I simply used \texttt{combotest-regular} and \texttt{combotest-bold}.
      
  \item[\marg{comma list of basefonts}] This should be a list of font declarations you want to use to build your combo font. The syntax used is described in the \package{luaotfload} manual. Example:
      
\begin{verbatim}
{
 {file:lmroman10-regular.otf:\combodefaultfeat} at #1pt,
 {file:lmsans10-regular.otf} at \fpeval{#1/10*15}pt,
 {file:cmunrm.otf}           at #1pt
}
\end{verbatim}

Important points are:
\begin{description}
\item[Order of the fonts] The first font is the main font which will receive the glyphs. So think carefully which font is should be and setup its font features correctly. \package{combofont} defines as a helper command \verb+\combodefaultfeat+ which sets \texttt{mode=node;script=latn;language=DFLT;+tlig;}. 
    
\item[Size declaration] The font description should end with a size declaration line \verb+at #1pt+. When processing the font \verb+#1+ will be replaced by the current font size. As you can see in the second font you can do calculations.
\end{description}

\item[\marg{comma list of ranges and code-points}] This is a comma list of settings which describe which glyphs are taken from the respective font. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
{
   {} ,
   0x41-0x5A*0x21*0x3F,
   fallback
}
\end{verbatim}

Important points:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There should be as many settings as there are fonts.
\item Empty entries should be marked with a pair of braces (normally this should done for the first font).
\item You can add ranges of code points and single code points. Blocks are separated by an asterix \verb+*+. 
\item The keyword \texttt{fallback} means that this font is used for „missing glyphs“  
\end{enumerate}  
\end{description}

\subsection{Write \texttt{nfss}-declarations}

After all the fonts you need have been setup, you can write suitable \texttt{nfss}-declaration which make it possible to call the font by family and other font commands. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
\DeclareFontFamily{TU}{combotest}{}
\DeclareFontShape {TU}{combotest}{m}{n} {<->combo*combotest-regular}{}
\DeclareFontShape {TU}{combotest}{bx}{n}{<->combo*combotest-bold}{}
\end{verbatim}

The important point is the size-function \verb+combo*+ which does all the work.

\section{Remarks and open questions}

As mentioned in the introduction a combo font only pulls in glyphs. This has a lot of (not all yet understood or seen) side effects. Here a few things that should be considered when building a combo font:

\begin{description}
  \item[Kerning] Obviously some kerning works (see e.g. the large W before the o in the demonstration). But it is quite unclear which values are used, how bad it can get and if one can correct it.
  \item[Font features] Only font features of the first font are taken into account. E.g. adding a color setting has an effect only if applied to the first font and then colors all glyphs. \verb!+smcp! (the open type small caps feature) only has an effect if the first font knows it. Mixing scripts and languages is probably not possible (but I didn't try yet).
  \item[Speed] I didn't try to optimize the loading of the fonts. 
  \item[Pulling glyphs in other positions] One interesting question would if it is possible to switch glyph positions before or after the pull. E.g. is one could move the chars a-z from arial to the math serif positions. 
  \item[Side effect] I naturally directly found a side-effect of such a combo font declaration: https://github.com/lualatex/luaotfload/issues/414. So the question is if there are more.
